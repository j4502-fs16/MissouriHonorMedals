<p>“For Distinguished Service in Journalism” was the explanation Dean Walter Williams, of the University of Missouri School of Journalism, provided in 1930 when he announced the first group of honorees during the institution’s Journalism Week. The Missouri School of Journalism has awarded its Missouri Honor Medals in 1930 to two newspapers, two publishers, and a foreign correspondent.</p>

<p> Medalists are selected by the faculty of the School on the basis of lifetime or superior achievement, for distinguished service performed in such lines of journalistic endeavor as shall be selected each year for consideration. </p>

<p> Dean Williams added that the awards would not be restricted necessarily to any particular form of journalistic service, nor would there be necessarily any designated number of medals voted each year” as recommended by the school’s special committee, approved by the entire faculty, and subsequently by the University Board of Curators

The annual awards shall not be restricted necessarily to any particular forms of journalistic service, nor will there be, necessarily, any designated number voted annually by the School. The award, or Medal of Honor, in each instance shall consist of a bronze medal, uniform in size, of appropriate design, and suitably inscribed with the recipient’s name. Awards shall be made only to those persons who, upon invitation, are present in person to receive them, or in the case of newspapers, periodicals, radio and television stations or other organizational entities, when such are represented in person by an official representative. </p>

<p> During the day the medalists will present master classes on topics related to their areas of expertise to Missouri School of Journalism students and other guests. </p>
