<p> The Missouri School of Journalism has awarded its Missouri Honor Medal for Distinguished Service in Journalism since 1930. </p>

<p> Medalists are selected by the faculty of the School on the basis of lifetime or superior achievement, for distinguished service performed in such lines of journalistic endeavor as shall be selected each year for consideration. </p>

<p> The annual awards shall not be restricted necessarily to any particular forms of journalistic service, nor will there be, necessarily, any designated number voted annually by the School. The award, or Medal of Honor, in each instance shall consist of a bronze medal, uniform in size, of appropriate design, and suitably inscribed with the recipientâ€™s name. Awards shall be made only to those persons who, upon invitation, are present in person to receive them, or in the case of newspapers, periodicals, radio and television stations or other organizational entities, when such are represented in person by an official representative. </p>

<p> During the day the medalists will present master classes on topics related to their areas of expertise to Missouri School of Journalism students and other guests. </p>
