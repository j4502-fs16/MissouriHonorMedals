<h2>Banquet<h2>

<p> The Missouri Honor Medal Banquet climactially wraps up a day of master classes with a celebratory dinner. The banquet honors the nominees with a formal three-course dinner. Each medalist is then introduced by the dean or provost, presented with a medal and invited to give a speech. Before and after the banquet, students and faculty can interact with the recipients in a more conversational atmosphere.
